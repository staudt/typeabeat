# typeabeat
A little drum machine that plays one line text patterns. You can try it [here](http://staudt.github.io/typeabeat/).

This project just barely started, so don't expect much at this point.

Inspired by other cool drum machines such as [beats](https://github.com/jstrait/beats) and [mmodm](https://github.com/MMODM/mmodm). We're currently using the drum samples from [ng-drum](https://github.com/RoryDH/ng-drum)
